### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a quantitative social scientist and data science educator. My GitHub mostly contains instructional material for the Flatiron School's Data Science programs. You can see my academic works [here](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8301-6785). I'd love to connect with people who care about teaching, data, and any combination of the two.
