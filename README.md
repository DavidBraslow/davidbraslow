I am an education data scientist who focuses on teaching and learning. My GitHub mostly contains instructional material for the Flatiron School's Data Science programs, which I helped run. You can see my academic works [here](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8301-6785). Don't hesitate to reach out if you're interested in connecting!
